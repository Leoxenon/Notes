- Real vector space
	- a set of vectors together with rules for vector addition and multiplication by real numbers
		- if x, y in the space, x + y in the space
		- if x in the space, cx is in the space
- Column Space of a Matrix A
	- all linear combinations of the columns of A
- The solvability of Ax = b
	- The system Ax = b is solvable 
		- **if and only if** the vector b can be expressed as a combination of the columns of A
		- i.e. b is in the column space
	- Geometric description
		- 𝐴x = 𝑏 can be solved **if and only** if 𝑏 lies in the **plane** that is spanned by the two column vectors
- Nullspace of A
	- $N(A)$
	- The solutions to Ax = 0

- All solvable linear equations have the form
	- $x = x_p + x_n$
		- $x_p$ is a particular solution
		- $x_n$ is any vector in the nullspace
	- $Ax_p = b$ and $Ax_n = 0$
		- $A(x_p + x_n) = b$

- Echelon Form U
	- with zeros below the pivots
		- The pivots are the first nonzero entries in their rows
		- Below each pivot is a column of zeros, obtained by elimination
		- Each pivot lies to the right of the pivot in the row above
		- This produces the staircase pattern, and zero rows come last.
- Reduced Row Echelon Form R
	- pivots are all 1s
	- In the columns of pivots
		- all other elements are 0s
- Rx = 0 has the same solutions as Ux = 0 and Ax = 0
	- Pivot variables
		- Corresponding to columns with pivots
	- Free variables
		- Corresponding to columns without pivots
	- Use free variables to represent pivot variables
	- Nullspace contains all combinations of special solutions
- Solving Ax = b
	- Find Nullspace by solving Ax = 0
	- Forward elimination Ax = b
		- produce Ux = c
	- Find the particular solution with free variables = 0
	- $x_{complete} = x_{particular} + x_{nullspace}$

- The Rank of a Matrix (r)
	- The number of pivots in the elimination process
	- The number of independent rows in the matrix A
- Linear Independence and Dependence
	- Suppose $c_1v_1 + ... + c_kv_k = 0$
		- only happens when $c_1 = ... = c_k = 0$
			- the vectors are linearly independent
		- if any c are nonzero
			- the vectors are linearly dependent
			- one vector is a combination of the others
	- A set of n vectors in $R^m$ (dimension m) must be linearly dependent if n > m

- Spanning a Space
	- The column space of A is spanned by the columns whose combinatios produce the whole space
- Basis for a Vector Space
	- a sequence of vectors having two properties at once
		1. The vectors are linearly independent
		2. They span the space
	- A vector space has infinite different bases
	- a maximal independent set
	- a minimal spanning set
	- Whenever a square matrix is invertible
		- its columns are a basis for $R^n$
- Dimension of a Vector Space
	- degrees of freedom
	- The number of basis vectors
	- is a property of the space

- Equavalent to Invertibility
	- The rows/columns are linearly independent
	- The rows/columns span $R^n$
	- $Ax = b$ has only one solution for each $b$
	- $Ax = 0$ has only the solution $x = 0$
