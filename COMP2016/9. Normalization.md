- First Normal Form
	- No multivalued attributes
	- Every attribute value is atomic
- Second Normal Form
	- 1NF
	- every non-key attribute is fully functionally dependent on the <span style="color: red;">entire</span> primary key
		- no partial functional dependency on the primary key
	- Partial Functional Dependency
		- A function dependency in which one or more non-key attributes are functionally dependent on part (but not in all) of the primary key
	- transform to 2NF
		- Decompose the relation into two separate relations
- Third Normal Form
	- 2NF
	- no transitive dependencies
	- Transitive Dependency
		- a functional dependency between two (or more) non-key attributes
	- transform to 3NF
		- Decompose the relation into two separate relations
			- Using foreign key to link
	- A formal way to determine 3NF
		- for every FD X -> A in F, at least one of the following conditions holds
			- A âˆˆ X, that is, X -> A is a trivial FD
			- X is a superkey
			- if X is not a key, then A is part of some key
