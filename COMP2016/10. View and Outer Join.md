- **View**
	- virtual table
	- frequently access to information
	- customized and autorized data access for different users
- Create a virtual table
```sql
CREATE VIEW StudentsLimited AS 
	SELECT sid, sname, age 
	FROM Students
```
- Renaming Attributes
```sql
CREATE VIEW StudentsLimited(stuId, stuName, age) AS 
	SELECT sid, sname, age 
	FROM Students
```
- Creating view from multiple tables
```sql
CREATE VIEW Roster(stuName, cid, day) AS 
	SELECT sname, cid, day 
	FROM Student S, CourseEnrolled E 
	WHERE S.sid = E.sid
```
- Querying a view
```sql
SELECT cid 
FROM Roster 
WHERE stuName = 'Bob'
```
```sql
SELECT cid, count(sname) 
FROM Roster 
GROUP BY cid
```
- Drop View
```sql
Drop View Roster;
Drop View StudentsLimited;
```

- **Natural Join**
	- DISTINCT
	- check all common attributes
```sql
SELECT sid, sname, bid 
FROM Sailors NATURAL JOIN Reserves
```
- **Inner Join**
	- Only includes matched rows
```sql
SELECT S.sid, sname, bid 
FROM Sailors S INNER JOIN Reserves R ON S.sid = R.sid
```
- **Left Outer Join**
	- Includes unmatched rows of the left table
```sql
SELECT S.sid, sname, bid 
FROM Sailors S LEFT OUTER JOIN Reserves R 
	ON S.sid = R.sid
```
- **Right Outer Join**
	- Includes unmatched rows of the right table
```sql
SELECT sid, B.bid, bname 
FROM Reserves R RIGHT OUTER JOIN Boats B 
	ON R.bid = B.bid
```
- **Full Outer Join**
	- Includes unmatched rows of both tables
```sql
SELECT sid, B.bid, bname 
FROM Reserves R FULL OUTER JOIN Boats B 
	ON R.bid = B.bid
```
- **General Format for Joins**
	- INNER is default
```sql
SELECT (column_list) 
FROM table_name 
	[INNER | {LEFT |RIGHT | FULL } OUTER] JOIN table_name 
	ON qualification_list 
WHERE â€¦
```
