Database design steps:
- Requirement analysis
- Conceptual database design
- Logical database design
- Physical database design

- Entity-Relationship Diagram (ER Diagram)
	Ã˜Represent rules in terms of entities and their relationships

- Entity: a real-world object distinguishable from other objects
- Attributes: characteristics that an entity has
- Entity set: A set of entities that share the same attributes

![[entity set representation.png]]

- Key: minimal set of attributes whose value uniquely identifies an entity
	- candidate keys: can be more than one
	- primary key: the one the designer choose

Attribute types:
- simple attribute
- composite attribute

- single-valued
- multi-valued

- derived attribute
- non-derived attribute

- Relation: set of tuples (table in relational model)
- Relationship: relationship between entities

- Self relationships
	the same entity set participates in one relationship
	![[Self relationship.png]]

- Key
	- Keys for entity sets 
		The minimal set of attributes whose value uniquely identifies an entity
	- Primary key for entity sets
		The only key that represent an entity
		
	- Keys for relationship sets
		The union of the primary keys of the participating entity sets contains the primary key of a relationship set.
		e.g. {key1, key2}
	- Primary key for relationship sets
		- one to one
			{key1} or {key2}
		- one to many
			{key2}
		- many to one
			{key1}
		- many to many
			{key1, key2}

- Ternary relationship set
	![[Ternary relationship set.png]]

- Strong entities
	- exists independently
	- has unique identifier
- Weak entities
	- dependent on a strong entity via an identifying relationship set
	- does not have a unique indentifier
	- has no primary key, but partial key
	- primary key: (partial key, primary key)
- Identifying relationship set
	- primary key: (partial key, primary key)
	![[weak entity representation.png]]

- Class (ISA) Hierarchies
	- A ISA B: A entity is also considered to be a B entity
	![[ISA representation.png]]

Constraints on class hierarchy
- Disjoint
- Overlapping
- Covering
- Non-covering

- Aggregation
