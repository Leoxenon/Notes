- Multiprocessor scheduling problem
	- which processor should run
	- when to run

- Load Sharing
	- The ready processes wait in a central pool
	- The available processor will be assigned with a process by the OS
	- must be applied in conjunction with uniprocessor shceduling method
		- Load Sharing + FCFS
			- The central pool is a FIFO queue
		- Load Sharing + Priority Scheduling
			- The central pool consists of N FIFO queues
- Two-Level Scheduling
	- Level 1
		- Each process is assigned to one of the processors
	- Level 2
		- separate pools of ready processes for each processor
		- each processor forms a sub-system
	- must be applied in conjunction with uniprocessor scheduling method
	- <span style="color: red;">The CPU utilization rate is lower than load sharing</span>

- Microsoft Windows Scheduling
	- Highlights
		- the basic unit is thread
		- conbines several scheduling methods
			- Load sharing
				- all ready threads wait in a central pool
			- Priority scheduling + Round robin shceduling
				- Priority scheduling
					- 32 priority levels
				- Modified round robin scheduling
					- The priority of a thread may be adjusted after quantum expiry
			- Preemptive shceduling
				- low-priority thread can be preempted and suspended
	- Priority Management
		- Base priority: the overall priority of a thread
			- process priority
				- process priority classes
					- Real-time Priority
					- High Priority
					- Above Normal
					- Normal (Default)
					- Below Normal
					- Idle
			- thread priority
				- thread priority levels
					- Time-critical
					- Highest
					- Above Normal
					- Normal (Default)
					- Below Normal
					- Lowest
					- Idle
		- Priority Adjustment
			1. give higher priority to the application in the foreground
			2. give higher priority to the application involves user's input
			3. give higher priority to the application waits for I/O
	- Desirable features
		- good user experience
		- all parties (OS, developer, user) could select to adjust the priority


Suppose there are two processors and N processes, where these processes do not involve I/O. For each of the following cases, determine the total number of possible schedules
Case 1: Processes are preemptive 
	$=∞$
Case 2: Processes are non-preemptive
	$= ∑C(N, i) i! (N-1)!$
	$= ∑N!$
	$= (N+1)!$
