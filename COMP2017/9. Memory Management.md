- Memory address
	- physical address

- Memory allocation problem
	- How the OS allocate memory space to multiple processes

- Contiguous Allocation
	- The OS allocates a contiguous memory block to each process
	- partition
		- a contiguous memory block
	- Logical and Physical Address
		- logical address
			- the memory address relative to the starting byte
		- physical address
			- the actual memory address
		- physical address = base address + logical address
		- Why using both logical &physical addresses
			- Flexibility 1
				- A program can be loaded into any memory partition for execution
			- Flexibility 2
				- The OS can relocate a process from one memory partition to another memory partition
	- Variable Partition Size
		- The partition size is variable, fitting the need of every individual process
		- When some processes are terminated, some memory holes of different sizes are left
		- External Fragmentation problem
			![[External Fragmentation problem.png]]
			- Solution 1 - Merging
				- only when the holes are adjacent
			- Solution 2 - Compaction
				- relocates all the occupied partitions to one end, leaving one big hole at the other end
				- takes a long time
				- when a process is being relocated, its execution is suspended
		- Selection of Memory Hole
			- Best-fit method
				- selects the hole that best fits
				- slow to search the best-fit one
			- First-fit method
				- selects the first hole that is big enough
				- may not be good enough
			- Worst-fit method
				- selects the largest hole
				- may be large enough for another new process
				- slow to find the worst-fit one

- Paging
	- Memory is divided into fixed-size memory blocks (4KB)
	- pages
	- the OS allocate non-contiguous memory blocks to each process
	- Logical Address and Physical Address
		- Logical address
			- (page number, page offset)
		- Physical Address
			- Base address + page offset
		- Page Table
			- record the locations (Base adress) of all pages for each process
		- Changing Logical Address to Physical Address
			- logical address: (p, d)
			- use p and the page table to find the base address
			- use d to find the address of a particular byte
	- Two-Level Paging
		- logical address: (P1, P2, d)
		- use p1 and p2 to find out the base address of the page
		- use d to find the address of a particular byte
		![[Changing logical address to physical address in two-level paging.png]]
	- Internal Fragmentation
		- a process does not use up all the allocated memory space
- Segmentation
	- allocates **non-contiguous** but **variable-size** memory blocks
	- involves large overhead to manage the memory holes
