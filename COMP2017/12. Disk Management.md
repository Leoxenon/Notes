- Hard Disk
	- platter
		- circular magnetic disk for storing data
		- two sides
			- track
				- sector
					- 4 KB
		- up to 2 TB
		- rotated synchronously
	- read-write heads
		- move forward and backward
	- block
		- OS formats the hard disk
		- smallest storage unit used by the OS
		- default 4 KB

- Disk Scheduling
	- FCFS Scheduling
		- slow
	- SCAN Scheduling
		- The read-write head moves outward, accessing the requested blocks along the outward direction
		- The read-write head moves inward, accessing the requested blocks along the inward direction

- Fragmentation
	- non-contiguous blocks
		- slower
	- the OS performs defragmentation
		- disk defragmenter
			- start -> disk defragmenter
		- factors that affect the speed of defragmentation
			- number of files
			- degree of fragmentation
			- speed of hard disk
			- efficiency of defragmentation algorithm

- Solid State Drive (SSD)
	- non-volatile memory (NAND flash memory)
		- more costly than hard disks
		- faster than hard disks
		- memory cell has a limited lifespan
			- around tens of thousands
	- blocks
		- a block has 128 - 512 pages
		- pages
			- a page has 4 - 16 KB
			- data can be written into any individual empty page
				- must erase the existing data in all pages of the block before write
					- copy other pages to another block and erase the previous block
			- when a page could be erased
				- marked as erasable
			- when all pages of a block are erasable
				- the OS informs the SSD via TRIM command
				- the SSD marks this block as erasable
				- erases the block at appropriate time
					- idle time

- Intel Optane Memory
	- non-volatile memory
	- faster but more costly than SSDs
	- used as a cache for SSD/hard disk
		- stores frequently used files 
	- 16 GB or 32 GB

- RAM Disk
	- volatile memory
	- speed up file access
	- use some memory space to form a volume
		- with a separate file system
	- when a RAM disk is started
		- copy the folders and files from hard disk to RAM disk
	- when new files are created or existing files are modified
		- the files are written back to the hard disk
	- 50 - 100 times faster than hard disks
	- 10 times faster than SSDs
	- merit
		- speed up file access at relatively low cost
	- demerit
		- volatile 
			- file loss because of an unexpected shutdown
	- applications
		- that need intensive file read
			- web server
			- database
