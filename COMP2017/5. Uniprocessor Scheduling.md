- Processor
	- n-core CPU has n processors
- Basic unit of execution
	- Single thread process model: Process
	- Multi-thread process model: Thread
- Process
	- a "process" refers to any basic unit of execution

- Scheduling Objectives
	- Waiting Time
		- the time interval between a process becomes ready and it starts running
		- Objective
			- MInimize or reduce the mean waiting time
	- Turnaround Time
		- the time interval between process submission and completion
		- Objective
			- Minimize or reduce the mean turnaround time
	- Fairness
		- Fairness is subjective 
		- Objective
			- Processes can fairly share the processor

- Scheduling Disciplines
	- Preemptive Scheduling
		- An OS can suspend a running process and schedule to run another process
	- Non-preemptive Scheduling
		- Once a process starts running, it keeps running until:
			- it completes execution
			- it switches to the blocked state to wait for I/O completion

- First-Come-First-Served Scheduling （FCFS）
	- if a process is ready first, it is served first
	- first-in-first-out (FIFO) queue
	- can be shown in a Gantt chart
	- Properties of FCFS Method
		- <span style="color: red;">fair</span>
		- simple
		- non-preemptive
		- undesirable features
			- A short process may wait for a long process
			- An important process may wait for an unimportant process
- Shortest-Job-First Scheduling (SJF)
	- selects the process that requires the smallest running time and run it to completion
	- Properties of SJF Method
		- non-preemptive
		- gives <span style="color: red;">the smallest mean waiting time</span>
		- gives large waiting time variance
- Priority Scheduling
	- maintains N first-in-first out (FIFO) queues
	- runs the first process in the non-empty highest priority queue.
	- <span style="color: red;">better support the important processes</span>
	- can be either preemptive or non-preemptive
	- starvation problem
		- When new and high priority processes are steadily arriving, low-priority processes wait indefinitely
- Round Robin Scheduling
	- runs a process for a duration up to a given value (quantum)
	- preemptive
	- <span style="color: red;">short turnaround (waiting) time for short process</span>
- Multilevel Feedback Queue Scheduling
	- <span style="color: red;">better favour short processes</span>
	- <span style="color: red;">without knowing the running time information</span>
	- If a process has been running for a longer time
		- give lower priority
	- Two-level Feedback Queue Scheduling
		![[Two-level Feeadbakc QUeue Scheduling.png]]
		- 1st queue
			- higher priority
			- smaller quantum size
		- 2nd queue
			- lower priority
			- larger quantum size
- Fair-Share Scheduling
	- Fairness Problem
		- do not consider the owner of each process
	- ensure all users faily share the processor
	- must be applied in conjunction with a scheduling method
