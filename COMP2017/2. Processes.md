- process
	- a program
	- the current execution activity

- concurrency
	- pseudo-concurrency
	- real-concurrency

- process states
	- running state
	- ready state
	- blocked state
	![[Possible state transitions.png]]

- process elements
	- program
		- consists of a sequence of instructions
	- data
		- used by the program
	- stack
		- stores the information about every function call
	- process control block
		- stores the current information about the process
			- records the current state of a process
			- records the current priority of a process

- process control block
	- process ID
	- state
	- memory pointers
		- to program
		- to data
		- to stack
		- to the end
	- program counter
		- memory address of the next instruction
	- priority
	- context data
		- stored in the CPU registers
	- others

- process table
	- records the PCBs of all ongoing processes
	- records the pointers to the PCBs
	- contains important information
	- can only be accessed/updated by the OS

- memory allocation for process
	![[memory allocation for process.png]]

- context switch
	- save the information of process A from CPU to memory
	- restore the information of process B from memory to CPU
	- time consuming
		- memory speed is relatively slow
		- system bus is relatively slow

- creating a process
	1. allocate resources (memory space) to this new process
	2. create the four elements of a process
		- load program to memory
		- load data to memory
		- create a stack
		- create a PCB
			- decides its item values (process ID)
			- added into the process table
- terminating a process
	- removes the four elements of the process
	- gets back the resources allocated to this process

- interprocess communication
	- shared memory
	- message passing
		- is applicable for remote processes

- program
	- static contents
		- source instructions
		- data
- process
	- static contents
	- dynamic contents
		- about current execution activity
			- PCB
			- stack

- future computers better supporting concurrent processes
	- more CPU cores
	- faster memory speed and system bus
	- Intel Hyper-threading
