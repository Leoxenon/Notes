		- create a new class inherits the Thread class
		- implements the run() method
	- Creating and running a thread
		- create an object
		- run the start() method
	- Waiting for thread completion
		- run the join() methods
		- InterruptedException()

- Passing values between Threads
	- via class variables

## Multi-process
- ProcessBuilder and Process Class
	- ProcessBuilder
		- Make the necessary preparation for a new process
	- Process
		- Manage the running process
	- are packaged in java.lang

- Creating a Child Process
	- $\text{command}$
		`notepad cs_baby.txt`
- java program
```java
ProcessBuilder PBuild = new ProcessBuilder(“notepad”, “cs_baby.txt”); 
	Process p = PBuild.start();
```
	  $\text{command}$
		`java -cp d:/lab/bin MyProg 10`
- java program
```java
	ProcessBuilder PBuild = new ProcessBuilder(“java”, “-cp”, “d:/lab/bin” “MyProg”, “10”);
	Process p = PBuild.start();
```


- Waiting for Process Completion
	- p.waitFor();

- Redirecting Outputs
	- PBuild.inheritIO();
