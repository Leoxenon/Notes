 Threads
	threads of execution
		number of concurrent execution paths

- Single-Thread Process Model
	- Each process has exactly one thread of execution
	- program creates more new processes to run respective functions
	- elements
		- program
		- data
		- process information
			- stack
			- process control block
- Multi-Thread Process Mode
	- each process can have multiple thread of execution
	- program creates more new threads to run respective functions
	- elements
		- program
		- data
		- process information
			- process control block
		- thread information
			- thread control block
			- stack

- Properties of Threads
	- Thread creation is faster than process creation
		- new process: create 5 elements
		- new thread: create 2 elements
	- When a process is terminated, all threads are terminated
	- When a thread completes execution, other threads continue execution

- Multi-Process Design
	- Each concurrent task of an application is run as a separate process with one thread
	- Merit
		- terminating a process would not affect other processes
	- Demerit
		- significant overhead to create processes
- Multi-Thread Design
	- Each concurrent task of an application is run as a separate thread
	- Merit
		- small overhead to create threads
	- Demerit
		- fatal error in each thread can make the process stop normal execution

- Intel's Hyper-Threading
	- Reduce the context switch time
	- core of CPU without hyper-threading
		- an execution unit
		- one set of fast storage for storing the thread information
	- core of CPU with hyper-threading
		- one extra set of fast storage for storing the information of another thread
	- Principle
		- CPU core runs thread 2
		- saves thread 1's info concurrently
		- restores thread3's info concurrently

When a thread completes execution, its corresponding process is terminated
- Case 1: The process has one thread (True)
- Case 2: The process has multiple threads (False)
