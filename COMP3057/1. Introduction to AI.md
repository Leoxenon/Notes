- The Birth of AI
	- 1950s
	- Turing Test
		- Two hidden entities
			- One human
			- One machine
		- If the tester can't tell which is which
			- the machine passes the test
- Early Hopes
	- 1956-1970
- The AI Winter Blues
	- 1969
	- Overpromises
		- Actual capability, Funding cuts, lack of computing power
- Handwriting Heroes
	- 1990s
- Deep Learning Jams
	- 2000s
	- 2006: Geoffrey Hinton
		- Deep Belief Networks learn without a teacher
	- Hinton's grandfather: George Boole
		- creator of Boolean logic
- Deep Learning Boom & GPUs Turn Up the Heat
	- 2010s
- Generative AI
	- 2020s

- Human Intelligence
	- Ability to learn from experiences
	- Ability to adapt to new situations
	- Ability to reason and make decisions
	- Ability to create and solve problems
- Human intelligence vs AI
	- Both process information and learn patterns
	- Human brain uses neurons; AI uses artificial neurons
	- Both improve with training
	- Key difference: AI learns from data, humans learn from life experiences
- Human intelligence allows us to perceive the world, analyze information, and respond appropriately.

- Neuron in AI
	- A neuron is a tiny unit that processes information
		- It takes inputs
		- Processes them using weights and bias
		- Then sends out an output

- Training and Testing
	- To fairly evaluate an AI model
		- it must be tested on data it hasn't seen during training
	- Training
		- Data collection
			- Data source
				- The dataset repository or data source where the model retrieves raw training data
		- Input preparation
			- Input data
				- The training samples fed into the model
		- Forward pass
			- The model processes the input through its layers to produce an output (prediction)
				- Input data flows through the layers of the network
				- Each layer applies weights and operations
				- The final layer gives the prediction
		- Loss calculation
			- Comparing the model’s prediction with the ground truth using a loss function
		- Backward & Update
			- Updating the model’s parameters via backpropagation to improve performance
				- Make a prediction (forward pass)
				- Calculate the difference between prediction and the correct answer (loss)
				- Send this error backward through the layers
				- Each layer updates its weights a little to do better next time.
