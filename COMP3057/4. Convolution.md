- Convolution
	- describes how the shape of one signal is modified by another
	- a mathematical operation that blends two signals
	- it is widel used in image processing and signal processing
- Convolution in Neural Network
	- Filters in Early layers
		- find simple features like lines and edges
	- Filters in Middle layer 
		- combine them into shapes and parts such as corners and circles
	- Filters in Deep layer 
		- combine parts into whole objects like faces, cats, or cars
- Basic Structure of Convolution
	- key components
		- Input
			- Data to be processed
		- Kernel (filter)
			- a small matrix of weights
			- knowledge is encoded in the **numbers inside convolution kernels**
			- the weights are **learned through training** on data
			- each kernel captures a specific **pattern** or **feature** in the input image
		- Output (feature map)
			- result of sliding the kernel
	- The kernel slides across the input
		- performs element-wise multiplication and sum
		- slides over the input image to extract features
		- Each number in the kernel represents a **weight** that influences how input pixels are combined
	- The result is a new image
		- feature map
		- highlights the presence of learned patterns
- Stride
	- how many steps the filter (kernel) moves each time
	- output becomes smaller when stride becomes larger
- Padding
	- add extra pixels (often zeros) around the border of the image
	- no padding
		- the filter (kernel) must always stay fully inside the image
		- the border pixels are not fully used
		- the output feature map becomes smaller than the input
	- with padding
		- allows the filter to slide across every pixel, including the edges
		- border information is preserved
		- the output feature map can be the same size as the input
			- same convolution
- Size change after convolution
	- $Output Size = \lfloor \frac{(W - K + 2P)}{S} \rfloor + 1$
	- W: input size
	- K: kernel size
	- P: padding
	- S: strike
- Why do we need convolution
	- image convolution enhances or suppresses specific visual patterns
		- Edge detection
			- e.g., vertical, horizontal
		- Smoothing
			- e.g., Gaussian blur
		- Sharpening
	- These operations are essential for feature extraction in CNN layers
