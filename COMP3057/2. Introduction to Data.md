- Data
	- pieces of information
	- text, images, audio, etc.
	- what computers use to learn, analyze, or make decisions
- Data come from
	- surveys
	- sensors
	- apps and websites
	- social media
	- scientifict experiments
- Why is data important
	- fuel for all AI and machine learning
	- more data $\to$ better learning (if data is good)
		- data quality and ethics
		- Some data can deceive the AI model, causing the AI model to see things differently than they actually are
- Data Dimension
	- how many coordinates we need to locate a point
	- more dimensions = more information
	- 1D Data
		- One number per sample
		- Looks like a simple list of numbers
		- **time series data**
			- changes over time
	- 2D Data
		- images
			- a grid of pixels
				- Pixel
					- the smallest addressable element in an image
			- Grayscale image
				- only contains brightness information (black, white)
				- One pixel = one number
					- 0 = black, 255 = white
				- is actually a matrix
			- Color image
				- contain full color information
				- Each pixel = 3 values $\to$ (R, G, B)
					- (255, 255, 255) = white, (0, 0, 0) = black
			- Image Size = Pixel Count
				- Image size = Height × Width × Channels
			- Image color channels
				- Computer breaks the original image on the left to the corresponding R, G, B Channel
			- Image resolution
				- pixel count in digital imaging per unit size
				- resolution = pixel density
				- higher resolution = more detail and sharper image
			- Image-related applications
				- Image denoising
				- Image inpainting
				- Image style transfer
				- Low-light image enhancement
				- Image deraining
	- 3D Data
		- Video
			- has a temporal dimension to indicate the object motions over time
			- Frame per second (fps)
				- Frame rate
				- the number of individual frames (or images) displayed per second in a video
			- Video-related applications
				- Video generation
				- Video tracking
- Denote Data during training
	- ${(x_i, y_i)}^N_{i=1}$
- Training and testing data
	- Training Data
		- the data used to teach the model
		- contains examples and correct answers
		- the model uses it to learn patterns
	- Testing Data
		- the data used to check how well the model learned
		- contains new examples the model has never seen before
		- measures generalization
			- the ability to handle new problems
	- Ground truth
		- what we assume to be correct for training and evaluation
		- the truth we compare predictions to
