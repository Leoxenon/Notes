- c * 1000^3 = 10
	c = 10 ^-8
	10^-8 * 10000^3 = 10000
- c * 1000 * log1000 = 10
	c = 1/300
	1/300 * 10000 * log10000 = 400/3 


- Running Time Calculations: General Rules
	- for loops
		- single for loops
			- at most running time of the statements inside the for loop * the number of iterations
		- nested for loops
			- number of iterations * complexity of inner loop * ...
	- consecutive statements
		- add together
	- condition statement
		- never more than the running time of the test plus the larger of the running times of S1 and S2

∑(j - i + 1) = ∑(j) + ∑(1 - i)
 = 1/2 (i + n - 1)(n - i) + (1 - i)(n - 1 - i + 1)
 = O(n^2 + i^2 + n * i + i ^ 2)
 = O(n^3)
