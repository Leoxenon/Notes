- Tree
	- represents hierarchical relationship
	- node
		- represents object
		- root
			- starting node
		- parent
			- root has no parent
		- child
			- leaves have no child
		- siblings
			- have the same parent
		- leaves
			- without any children
	- edge
		- represents relationship
		- A tree with N nodes has N-1 edges
	- path
		- a sequence of nodes, n1, n2, ..., nk
		- length
			- number of edges on the path, k-1
	- depth
		- the length of the unique path from root to the node
		- the height of a tree is equal to the height of the root
	- height
		- the length of the longest path from the node to a leaf
		- the depth of a tree is equal to the depth of the deepest leaf
	- subtree
		- any node together with all its descendants
	- representation
		- FirstChild pointer
			- point to next level
		- NextSibling pointer
			- point to same level

- Binary tree
	- each nodes can have at most two children
		- leftchild
		- rightchild
	- Strictly Binary Tree
		- each nonleaf node has non-empty left and right subtrees
	- Complete (Full) Binary Tree
		- strictly binary tree with all leaf nodes at level of the depth d
		- has $$2^0 + 2^1 + ... + 2^d = 2^{d+1} - 1$$ nodes
		- has depth O(log N) $$∵2^{d+1} - 1 = N ∴d = log(N + 1) - 1$$
		- For simple binary tree: 
			.$$∵N <= 2^{d+1}-1$$ 
			.$$∴2^{d+1} >= N+1$$ 
			.$$∴d >= log(N+1)-1$$
	- Linked structure
		- Each node = data cells + two child pointers
	- Tree Traversal
		- PreOrder traversal strategy
			- depth-first
			- cur-left-right
			- can obtain prefix expression
		- InOrder traversal strategy
			- left-cur-right
			- can obtain infix expression
		- PostOrder traversal strategy
			- depth-first
			- right-left-cur
			- can obtain postfix expression
