# Abstract Data Types
- Data Type
	- values
	- operations

- Abstract Data Type (ADT)
	- a set of operations
	- mathematical abstractions

- List ADT
	- Sequence of elements
	- predecessor
		- Ai-1 precedes Ai
	- successor
		- Ai+1 follows (succeeds) Ai
	- Implementation
		- Array-based
			- should estimate the maximum size
			- waste space
			- Adding/Deleting an element: O(N)
		- Pointer Implementation (Linked List)
			- a sequence of nodes
				- value
				- pointer to the next element
			- header (dummy node)
				- insert/delete a node at the front of the list
			- uneccessary to be stored adjacent in memory
			- uneccessary to know the maximum size
			- Variations
				- Doubly Linked List
				- Circularly Linked List
			- Advantages
				- Dynamic
				- Easy and fast insertions and deletions

- Stack ADT
	- last in first out (LIFO)
	- operations
		- Deletion (Pop): O(1)
		- Insertion (Push): O(1)
	- Implementation
		- Array
			- TopOfStack (-1 if empty)
			- Delete/Access/Add at the end: O(1)
		- Linked List
			- will never be full

- Queue ADT
	- first come first served
	- operations
		- Enqueue: joining a queue at the end (rear/tail)
		- Dequeue: removing an object from the front (head)
	- Implementation
		- Array
			- may run out of rooms
				- keep front at 0
				- circular queue
					- wrap around
					- use a variable to keep track of the queue length
			- important to check the queue for emptiness
		- Linked List
			- maintain a pointer to the last element

- Application of Stacks and Queues
	- Infix Expression
		- Operand operator Operand
	- Operator Precedence
	- Operator Association
		- left association
		- right association
	- Parenthesis
	- Postfix Expression
		- Operand Operand Operator
		- requires no parentheses
		- can be evalueated by using a stack
			- push operands to stack
			- operator pop its operands and push the result
			- the stack contains only the result in the end
	- Convert Infix to Postfix
		- stack
			- store operators
		- queue
			- store output
		- algorithm
			- Initialize stack S and queue Q
			- Scan the Infix expression from left to right
				- If operand, add it to Q
				- If operator and S is empty, push it to stack
				- If operator and S is not empty, compare precedence
					- If topStack is higher, pop and add it to Q
					- If equal precedence
						- If Left association, pop and add to Q
						- If Right association, push to S
					- If scanned character is higher
						- push to S
				- If parenthese
					- If left parenthesis, push to S
					- If right parenthesis, pop and add to Q until left parenthesis
					- discard the left parenthesis
			- After scanning
				- If S is not empty, pop
				- dequeue Q
