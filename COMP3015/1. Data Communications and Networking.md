			- Receiver
			- Medium
			- Message
				- Header
					- Overhead
					- Control Info
				- Data
					- Real user data
			- Protocol
				- Rules
	- Simplex Communications
		- communication only operates in one direction
		- Examples
			- radio or television broadcasting
	- Half-Duplex Communications
		- communication occurring in both directions, but in only one direction at a time
		- Examples
			- walkie talkies
	- Full-Duplex Communications
		- communication occurring in both directions, simultaneously
		- Examples
			- video communication via Skype, Face-Time, etc.
	- Point-to-Point Communications
		- Only two devices sharing the medium
	- Multipoint Communications
		- More than two devices sharing the same medium

- Networking
	- Point to point communication not usually practical
		- Devices are too far apart
		- Large set of devices would need impractical number of connections (N(N-1)/2)
	- Solution is to use a communications network
		![[Simplified Network Model.png]]
	- Networks
		- the interconnection of a set of devices capable of communication
		- Device
			- Host
				- large computer, desktop, laptop, workstation, cellular phone, or security system
			- Connecting device
				- a router that connects networks
				- a switch that connects devices
				- a modem that changes the form of data
			- Devices are connected using wired or wireless media
		- Classification of Networks by Geographical Area
			- Local-area network (LAN)
				- Smaller scope
					- Building or small campus
				- Usually owned by same organization as attached devices
				- Data rates much higher
				- Usually broadcast systems
				- Now some switched systems and ATM are being introduced
			- Metropolitan-area network (MAN)
				- Middle ground between LAN and WAN
				- Private or public network
				- High speed
				- Large area
			- Wide-area network (WAN)
				- Large geographical area
				- Crossing public rights of way
				- Rely in part on common carrier circuits
		- Network Topologies
			- the layout of the computers ad devices in a communications network
			- Star network
				- all of the computers and devices (nodes) on the network connect to a central devices (e.g. hub, switch), thus forming a star
			- Bus network
				- all of the computers and devices (nodes) on the network connect to a central devices (e.g. hub, switch), thus forming a star
			- Ring network
				- a cable forms a closed loop (ring) with all computers and devices arranged along the ring
		- Network Structure
			- Network edge
				- Applications and hosts
			- Network core
				- Routers
				- Network of networks
			- Access network
				- Connect hosts to the network core
		- Network Core
			- Mesh of interconnected nodes
				- Circuit switching
					- creates a direct physical connection between two nodes
					- A dedicated resource (link) will be reserved for each communication
						- Link bandwidth, switch capacity
						- Dedicated resources
							- no sharing
						- Circuit-like (guaranteed) performance
						- Call setup required
							- delay
					- leads to substantial wastage if the connected nodes do not communicate all the time
				- Packet switching
					- Data sent through network in discrete "chunks"
						- Data are broken down into separate units called **packets** before transmission
							- Control information must be added to packets in a header and/or trailer
							- sequence NO.
								- sign the original order in data
								- sent in order
								- may be received out of order
					- Internet and many other computer related types of traffic are **bursty** in nature
						- the transmission is highly irregular in time
					- Each end-end data stream is divided into packets
						- User A, B packets share network resources
						- Each packet uses full link bandwidth
						- Resources used as needed
					- Resource contention
						- Aggregate resource demand can exceed amount available
						- Congestion
							- packets queue, wait for link use
							- if the queue is full, new packets will be dropped
						- Store and forward
							- packets move one hop at a time
							- Node receives complete packet before forwarding
							![[store and forward  behavior.png]]
					- The packets are interleaved on the link
						- statistical multiplexing
	- Internetwork (internet)
		- two or more networks are connected
		- Networks are connected by internetworking devices
			- routers
		- The Internet
			- the particular internet that has originated from the ARPANET in USA 1970s
	- Performance Issues
		- **High data rate** 
			- Data rate
				- measures how fast we can transfer data from a source to a destination
				- bits per second (bps)
				- Byte per second (Bps)
		- **High capacity**
			- more users 
		- High reliability 
		- High security 
		- **Low latency** (or delay)
			- Latency
				- How long does it take a message to travel from one end to the other
				- $Latency = Distance / Velocity$
				- The variation in latency
					- jitter
		- Low cost
		- Low energy consumption 
		- Low space requirement 
		- Low administration overhead

- Protocols and Layers
	- Protocols and layering are the main structuring methods used to divide up network functionality to manage complexity
		- Divide functionality in layers organized vertically
		- Each protocol implements the functionality of that layer
		- Each protocol instance talks **virtually** to its peer instances using the protocol
			- peer entities are in same layers
		- Each protocol instance uses only the services of the lower layer
	- Protocol
		- A protocol is a set of rules and formats that govern the communication between communicating peers
		- A protocol is necessary for any function that requires cooperation between peers
		- Used for communications between entities in a system
			- each entity is an active element, which performs certain function according to the rules and procedures
		- Must speak the same language
		- Entities
			- User applications
			- e-mail facilities
			- terminals
		- Systems
			- Computer
			- Terminal
			- Remote sensor
		- Another way to view a protocol
			- treated as providing a service
			- peer entities use a protocol to provide a service to a higher-level peer entity
		- Each protocol defined two different interfaces
			- service interface
				- to the other objects on the same computer that want to use its communication services
			- peer interface
				- to its counterpart (peer) on another machine
		- A Simple Protocol
			- send file as a series of packets 
			- send a checksum 
			- receiver sends OK or not-OK message 
			- sender waits for OK message
			- if no response, resends entire file
		- Key Elements of a Protocol
			- Syntax
				- Data formats
				- Signal levels
			- Semantics
				- Control information
				- Error handling
			- Timing
				- Speed matching
				- Sequencing
		- Protocol Layering
			- Task of communication broken up into modules
				- Signal generation 
				- Interfacing
				- Synchronization
				- Error detection and correction
				- Addressing and routing 
				- Recovery 
				- Message formatting 
				- Security
			- Each module is performed at different level/layer
			- Each layer performs a related subset of the functions required to communicate with another system
			- The purpose of each layer is to provide certain services to higher layers, shielding those layers from the details of the offered services
			- Layers should be defined so that changes in one layer do not require changes in other layers
			- So, instead of using a single complex protocol, it’s more flexible to implement a stack of protocols
		- Protocol Architecture
			- The stack of protocols (protocol stack)
			- Used by a web browser on a host that is wirelessly connected to the Internet
				- Browser
				- HTTP
				- TCP
				- IP
				- 802.11

	- Exchange of Data
		- Protocol Data Unit (PDU)
			- The unit of data sent between peer entities
		- Control information is contained in a header
			- source address
			- destination address
			- sequence number
			- error-detection code, etc.
	- Encapsulation
		- the mechanism used to effect protocol layering
		- Lower layer wraps higher layer content, adding its own information to make a new message for delivery
	- Network Architecture Reference
		- network architecture
			- a set of layers and protocols
			- only specification but not implementation
		- Reference model
			- ISO OSI Reference Model
				- open system
					- a system implements open protocols
						- open protocols
							- protocol details are publicly available
				- International Organization for Standards (ISO) prescribes a standard to connect open systems
					- Open System Interconnection (OSI)
				- OSI Seven-Layer Model
					- User support group
						- Application
						- Presentation

		- Data Exchange using Internet Model
			![[Data Exchange using Internet  Model.png]]
		- Addressing Level
			![[Addressing Level.png]]
		- Internet Transport-Layer Protocol
			- TCP
				- reliable and in-order delivery
					- Connection setup
					- Flow control
						- sender won’t overwhelm receiver
					- Congestion control
						- senders “slow down sending rate” when network congested
				- Connection oriented protocol
					- Before any data transfer, TCP establishes a connection
						- One TCP entity is waiting for a connection (“server”)
						- The other TCP entity (“client”) contacts the server
				- Provide a reliable unicast end-to-end byte stream over an unreliable internetwork
					- Byte stream is broken up into chunks
						- segments
					- The receiver sends acknowledgements (ACKs) for segments
					- TCP maintains a timer. If an ACK is not received in time, the segment is retransmitted
					- Detecting errors
						- TCP has checksums for header and data
							- Segments with invalid checksums are discarded
						- Each byte that is transmitted has a sequence number
				- Applications using TCP
					- HTTP
						- Web
					- FTP
						- file transfer
					- Telnet
						- remote login
					- SMTP
						- email
			- UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
				- unreliable and unordered delivery
					- connectionless
					- no flow control
					- no congestion control
				- Goal
					- Data transfer between end systems
				- Why is there a UDP
					- no connection establishment (which can add delay) 
					- simple
						- no connection state at sender, receiver 
					- small segment header 
					- no congestion control
						- UDP can blast away as fast as desired
				- Applications
					- often used for streaming multimedia applications 
						- loss tolerant
						- rate sensitive 
					- other UDP uses
						- DNS
		- Internet Protocol (IP)
			- IP is the layer 3 of TCP/IP protocol stack
			- IPv4 specifies the interface with the higher layer, e.g., TCP, UDP
			- IP is an unreliable protocol providing a **best-effort** delivery service
				- It does NOT guarantee a datagram will arrive in correct order 
				- It does NOT guarantee a datagram will arrive within a certain time
				- It does NOT guarantee the datagram will ever arrive at its destination
			- Internet only provides a connectionless datagram service
				- Never set up virtual circuits
			- Each time a system wants to send a packet
				- it stamps the packet with the IP address of the destination, and then feeds the packet into the network
				- Routers are then responsible for determining the “best” route to forward the packet
					- So,it is simple, flexible and robust
					- But it’s unreliable- reliability is provided by upper layers
				- No call setup at network layer 
				- Routers: no state about end-to-end connections 
				- Packets forwarded using destination host address 
					- Packets between same source-destination pair may take different paths
			- IP Addressing
				- Internet Protocol (IP) address
					- a number that uniquely identifies each computer or device connected to the Internet
					- dotted-decimal notation
						- 32 bits in length
						- 4 sets of numbers
						- each byte is expressed as a decimal number
							- from 0 to 255
						- separated by a dot
					- Network part
						- higher order bits
							- identifying the network to which a host is attached
								- Netid
					- Host part
						- lower order bits
							- identifying the host in that network
								- Hostid
					- Classes of IP Addresses
						- The length of Netid and Hostid depends on the class of IP address
							- The longer the Hostid (shorter Netid)
								- the more hosts it can accommodate in the network
						![[Classes of IP Addresses.png]]
						![[Classes.png]]
						- Blocks
							- Each class is divided into a fixed number of blocks with each block having a fixed size
							![[Classes and Blocks.png]]
							- The number of addresses in class C is smaller than the needs of most organizations
					- Network address
						- Netid
							- Specific
						- Hostid
							- All 0s
					- Broadcast address
						- Netid
							- Specific
						- Hostid
							- All 1s
				- The DNS (domain name system)
					- is the method that the Internet uses to store domain names and their corresponding IP addresses
					- Domain name
						- text version of an IP address
						- The text in the domain name up to the first period identifies the type of Internet server
							- www
								- a Web server

1. 132 > 128
	the highest bit must be 1
	132-128 = 4 < 64
	the second highest bit must be 0
	10..., i.e. Class B (first byte is  128 -191)
	
	block: Netid: 132.21
	range: 132.21.0.0 - 132.21.255.255
	host address range: 132.21.0.1 - 132.21.255.254
2. 201 > 128
	201 - 128 = 73 > 64
	73 - 64 = 7 < 32
	110..., Class C (first byte is 192 - 224)
	
	block: Netid: 201.133.10
	range: 201.133.10.0 - 201.133.10.255
	host address range: 201.133.10.1 - 201.133.10.255

- Hierarchy of Networks
	- IP address is unique and universal
	- the network address
		- the first address in the block
			- is the one that is assigned to the organization
			- Used by routers outside the organization to route the packets destined for the network
	- Subnetting
		- Assemble the hosts into groups
		- Division of a network into smaller networks
			- subnet
		- Each subnet has its own subnetwork address
	- 3 levels of hierarchy
		- NetID
			- are managed by Regional Internet Registries
		- SubnetID
			- is extracted from the original hostid
				- at least 2 bits remain in the HostID
					- need subnetwork and broadcasting
			- also removing all 0 case and all 1 case
		- HostID
			- are managed by the network administrator
				- owner of the NetID
- Classless InterDomain Routing (CIDR)
	- network portion of address of arbitrary length
	- address format
		- a.b.c.d/x
		- where x is the number of bits in network portion of address
		- With CIDR, the service provider can aggregate the classful networks into a single classless advertisement
- Network from IP address perspective
	- device interfaces with same network part of IP address
	- can physically reach each other without intervening router
- Masking
	- How can a router find the network address or subnetwork address
	- Masking is the process of extracting the network address from an IP address
		- extracting NetID + SubnetID if subnetted
	- Mask
		- 32 bits
		- all bits for NetID are 1s
		- all bits for HostID are 0s
	- Masking is performed by the AND operation of the IP address and the mask bit by bit
