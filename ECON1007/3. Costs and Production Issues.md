- Economic Costs
	- Total revenue (TR) = price (P) × quantity sold (Q)
	- Total cost (TC) = market value of the inputs a firm used in production
		- opportunity costs of making output
		- explicit costs
			- require an outlay of money
		- implicit costs
			- do not require an outlay of money
		- Total costs = Explicit costs + Implicit costs
- Economic profit
	- Total revenue - Total cost
- Accounting profit
	- Total revenue - total explicit cost >= Economic profit

- Production function
	- relationship between quantity of inputs used to make a good and the quantity of output of that good
	- Marginal product
		- an increase in output that arises from an additional unit of input
		- slope of the production function
	- Diminishing marginal product
		- production curve gets flatter as production (output) rises
- Total-cost curve
	- relationship between quantity produced and total costs
	- gets steeper as the amount produced rises
		- Diminishing marginal product
		- Producing one additional unit of output requires more additional units of inputs and thus the costs of production gets costly

- Types of Cost
	- Fixed costs (FC)
		- do not vary with the quantity of output produced
	- Variable costs (VC)
		- vary with the quantity of output produced
	- Total cost (TC) 
		- Fixed cost + Variable cost
	- Average fixed cost (AFC)
		- Fixed cost / quantity of output
	- Average variable cost (AVC)
		- Variable cost / quantity of output
	- Average total cost (ATC)
		- Total cost / quantity of output
		- ATC = AVC + AFC
		- U-shaped
			- AFC: declines
			- AVC: rises
			- The bottom of the U-shaped ATC
				- Efficient scale
					- the quantity of output that minimizes ATC
	- Marginal cost (MC)
		- change in total cost / change in quantity
		- MC = ΔTC / ΔQ
		- rising marginal cost curve
			- diminishing marginal product
	- Relationship between MC and ATC
		- MC < ATC
			- average total cost is falling
		- MC > ATC
			- average total cost is rising
		- The marginal-cost curve crosses the average-total-cost curve at its minimum

- Costs in Short and Long Run
	- Firms have greater flexibility in the long-run
		- Long-run cost curves differ from short-run cost curves and are much flatter than short-run cost curves
		- Short-run cost curves lie on or above the long-run cost curves
	- Economies of scale
		- Long-run average total cost falls as the quantity of output increases
		- Increasing specialization among workers
	- Constant returns to scale
		- Long-run average total cost stays the same as the quantity of output changes
	- Diseconomies of scale
		- Long-run average total cost rises as the quantity of output increases
		- Increasing coordination problems
