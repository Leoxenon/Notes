- Consumer price index (CPI)
	- Measure of the overall level of prices or cost of goods and services bought by a typical consumer
	- Calculating CPI
		- Fix the basket
			- Choose the types of goods and services and their quantity amount consumed by the typical consumer
			- Which prices are most important to the typical consumer
			- Different  weight  apply to different goods, reflecting the importance of the goods
		- Find the prices at each point in time
		- Compute the cost of same basket of goods
		- Choose a base year and compute the CPI
			- Base year = benchmark
			- $CPI = \frac{\text{Price of basket of goods and services in current year}}{\text{Price of basket in base year}} × 100$
		- The inflation rate
			- $\text{Inflation Rate} = \frac{\text{CPI in current year} - \text{CPI in last year}}{\text{CPI in last year}} × 100\%$
- Producer Price Index (PPI)
	- Measure of the cost of a basket of goods and services bought by firms
	- Changes in PPI are often thought to be useful in predicting changes in CPI

- Problems in measuring the cost of living
	- Substitution bias
		- Prices do not change proportionately
		- Consumers substitute toward goods that have become relatively less expensive
	- Introduction of new goods
		- More variety of goods
	- Unmeasured quality change
		- Changes in quality

- GDP deflator
	- Reflects prices of all goods & services produced domestically
	- Compares the price of currently produced goods and services to the price of the same goods and services in the base year
- CPI
	- Reflects prices of goods & services bought by consumers
	- Compares price of a fixed basket of goods and services to the price of the basket in the base year

- Dollar figures from different times
	- $\text{Amount in today's dollars} = \text{Amount in year T dollars} × \frac{\text{Price level today}}{\text{Price level in year T}}$
	- Price level
		- A price index such as the CPI
- Norminal interest rate
	- Interest rate as usually reported without a correction for the effects of inflation
- Real interest rate
	- Interest rate corrected for the effects of inflation
	- ≈ nominal interest rate - inflation rate
