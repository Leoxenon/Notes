- Monopolistic Competition
	- Many sellers
	- Product differentiation
		- Not price takers
		- Downward sloping firm demand curve
	- Free entry and exit
		- Possible positive economic profit in the short run
		- Zero economic profit in the long run
	- Short Run Equilibrium
		- Profit maximization
			- MR = MC
			- Price: on the demand curve for the given quantity
			- if P > ATC
				- profit
			- if P < ATC
				- loss
	- Long Run Equilibrium
		- If firms are making profit in the short run
			- New firms have incentive to enter the market
			- Increase the number of producers
			- Reduces demand faced by each existing firm
				- demand curve shifts left, pushing price down
			- Each firmâ€™s profit declines until zero economic profit reaches
				- P = ATC at Q*
		- Zero economic profit
			- Demand curve tangent to average total cost curve
				- at quantity where MR = MC
			- Price = average total cost > marginal cost
				- Downward sloping demand curve must tangent to the downward sloping part of ATC curve
				- Output level is lower than the level at efficient scale (excess capacity)
				- MC is less than ATC when ATC is declining
			- Quantity: not at minimum ATC (excess capacity)
			- P > MC, markup over marginal cost
			- Sources of inefficiency
				- Markup of price over marginal cost
				- Deadweight loss of monopoly pricing

- Advertising
	- Incentive to advertise
		- when firms sell differentiated products and charge prices above marginal cost
		- advertise to attract more buyers
	- Advertising spending
		- Highly differentiated goods
			- 10%-20% of revenue
		- Industrial products
			- little advertising
		- Homogenous products
			- no advertising
	- Debate over advertising
		- wasting resources?
		- valuable purpose?
	- The critique of advertising
		- Firms advertise to manipulate people's tastes
			- Psychological rather than informational
			- Creates a desire that otherwise might not exist
		- Impedes competition
		- Increase perception of product differentiation
			- Foster brand loyalty
		- Makes buyers less concerned with price differences among similar goods
	- The defense of advertising
		- Provide information to customers
			- Customers can make better choices
			- Enhances the ability of markets to allocate resources efficiently
		- Fosters competition
			- Customers take advantage of price differences
		- Allows new firms to enter more easily
	- Advertising as a signal of quality
		- Little apparent information
		- Real information offered a signal about quality of the product
		- Content of advertising can be irrelevant
	- Brand names
		- Spend more on advertising and charge higher prices than generic substitutes
	- Critics of brand names
		- Products are indeed not differentiated
		- Irrationality
			- consumers are willing to pay more for brand names
	- Defenders of brand names
		- Information to consumers about quality
		- Incentive for firms to maintain high quality
