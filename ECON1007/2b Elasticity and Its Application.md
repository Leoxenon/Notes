- Elasticity
	- Measure of the responsiveness of quantity demanded or quantity supplied to a change in one of its determinants
- Price elasticity of demand/supply
	- Price E = Percentage change in Qd(Qs) / Percentage change in P
			= (ΔQd/Qd) / (ΔP/P) 
	- Midpoint method

		![[Price elasticity of supply.png]]
	- Elastic demand/supply
		- Quantity demanded/supplied responds substantially to changes in price
		- Price elasticity of demand > 1
	- Inelastic demand/supply
		- Quantity demanded/supplied responds only slightly to changes in price
		- Price elasticity of demand/supply < 1
	- Unity elastic demand/supply
		- Price elasticity of demand/supply = 1
		
	- The flatter the demand/supply curve, the greater the price elasticity of demand
	
	- Determinants of price elasticity of demand
		- Availability of close substitutes
			- Goods with close substitutes: more elastic demand
		- Necessities versus luxuries
			- Necessities: inelastic demand
			- Luxuries: elastic demand
		- Definition of the market
			- Narrowly defined markets: more elastic demand
		- Time horizon
			- Demand is more elastic over longer time horizons
	- Total revenue (TR)
		- Amount paid by buyers and received by sellers of a good
		- P × Q
		- For a price increase
			- If demand/supply is inelastic, TR increases
			- If demand/supply is elastic, TR decreases
			- if demand/supply is unit elastic, TR remains constant
	- Income elasticity of demand
		![[Income elasticity of demand.png]]
		- Normal goods
			- Positive income elasticity
			- Necessities
				- Smaller income elasticities
			- Luxuries
				- Large income elasticities
		- Inferior goods
			- Negative income elasticities
	- Cross-price elasticity of demand
		![[Cross-price elasticity of demand.png]]
		- Substitutes
			- Positive cross-price elasticity
		- Complements
			- Negative cross-price elasticity
