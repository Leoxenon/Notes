- Economic Fluctuations
	- irregular and unpredictable
	- Most macroeconomic quantities fluctuate together
	- As output falls
		- unemployment rises
	- Recession
		- Economic contraction
		- Period of declining real incomes and rising unemployment
	- Depression
		- Severe recession
	- Classical dichotomy
		- variables
			- real variables
			- nominal variables
		- Monetary neutrality
			- changes in the money supply
				- affect nominal variables
					- prices
				- do not affect real variables 
					- real GDP
					- unemployment
		- Classical theory holds in the long run
	- Short-Run Economic Fluctuations
		- Real and nominal variables are highly intertwined
		- AD-AS model
			- aggregate demand (AD) andÂ aggregate supply (AS)
			![[Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply.png]]
			- AD curve
				- Y = C + I + G + NX
					- Wealth effect
						- Price level and consumption (C)
					- Interest-rate effect
						- Price level and investment (I)
					- Exchange-rate effect
						- Price level and net exports (NX)
				- Government spending (G) is fixed by policy
				- AD curve shift
					- Changes in consumption, C
					- Changes in investment, I
					- Changes in government purchases, G
					- Changes in net exports, NX
			- AS curve
				- Short run aggregate-supply curve is upward sloping
					- Sticky-wage theory
						- Nominal wages is slow to adjust to changing economic conditions
						- If price level is different from the expected price, firms would adjust its production level
					- Sticky-price theory
						- Prices of some goods and services are slow to adjust to changing economic conditions
					- Misperceptions theory
						- Changes in the overall price level can temporarily mislead suppliers about changes in individual markets or changes in relative prices
					- Quantity of output supplied
						- $Y = Y_N + a(P - P_E)$
					- Short-run AS curve shift
						- Changes in labor
						- Changes in capital
						- Changes in natural resources
						- Changes in technological knowledge
						- Expected price level changes
							- negative relative
				- Long run aggregate-supply curve (LRAS) is vertical
					- Price level does not affect the long-run determinants of GDP
				- Natural level of output ($Y_N$)
					- Production of goods and services that an economy achieves in the long run when unemployment (due to frictional and structural unemployment) is at its normal rate
					- Potential output
					- Full-employment output
				- LRAS curve shift
					- Changes in labor
					- Changes in capital
					- Changes in natural resources
					- Changes in technological knowledge
				- Long-Run equilibrium
					- Economy begins in long-run equilibrium
					- Intersection of AD and LRAS
						- Natural level of output
						- Actual price level
					- Intersection of AD and AS
						- $P_E = P$
						- $Y = Y_N$
	- Long-Run Growth and Inflation
		- Both AD and LRAS curves shift
			- Continual shifts of LRAS curve to right
				- Technological progress
			- AD curve shifts to right
				- Monetary policy
					- the Central Bank increases money supply over time
			- Result:
				- Continuing growth in output
				- Continuing inflation
