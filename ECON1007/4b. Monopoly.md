- Monopoly
	- Sole producer
	- Price maker
	- Downward sloping firm demand curve
		- the market demand curve (MR < P)
	- Cause
		- barriers to enter the market
			- Monopoly resources
				- A key resource required for production is owned by a single firm
			- Government regulation
				- Government gives a single firm the exclusive right to produce some good or service
			- The production process
				- A single firm can supply a good or service to an entire market
	- A monopoly's total revenue
		- Total revenue = price times quantity
	- A monopoly's average revenue
		- AR = (P x Q)/Q = P(Q)
		- demand curve P
	- A monopoly’s marginal revenue
		- MR = ΔTR/ΔQ
		- MR < P
			- Downward-sloping demand
			- To increase the amount sold, a monopoly firm must lower the price it charges to all customers
		- MR curve is below the demand curve
		- MR can be negative
	- Increase quantity sold
		- Output effect
			- Increase Q, increase TR
		- Price effect
			- decrease P, decrease TR
	- Profit maximization
		- if MR > MC
			- increase production
		- if MC > MR
			- cut production
		- maximize profit–Common in case of natural monopolies
			- P > MR = MC
				- Price of the competitively production is below the monopolist’s price
			- intersection of MR and MC curve
			- given the output level, price is determined by the demand curve
		- Profit = TR - TC = (P x Q) – (ATC x Q) = (P – ATC) x Q
	- The quantity (MC = MR < P) is less than the socially efficient quantity of output (MC = MR = P)
		- Deadweight loss
			- indicated by lower level but higher price
			- Represented by the triangle between the demand curve and MC curve over the quantity difference between the monopoly and competitive firms
		- Monopoly profit is not a social problem
	- Regulation
		- Regulate the price of monopolists
		- Common in case of natural monopolies
		- Marginal-cost pricing (setting the monopoly price equal to MC)
			- May be less than ATC, leading to loss
			- If setting P = ATC, incentive to reduce costs if monopolist knows about the price control
