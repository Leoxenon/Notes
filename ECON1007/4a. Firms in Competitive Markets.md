- Competitive market
	- trading identical products
	- each buyer and seller is a price taker
	- firms can freely enter or exit the market

- Profit
	- Firm in a competitive market tries to maximize profit
	- Total revenue - total cost
		- positive profit
			- TR – TC = (P x Q) – (ATC x Q) = (P – ATC) ˣ Q
		- negative profit
			- TC - TR = (ATC – P) ˣ Q
	- Total revenue (TR) = P × Q
	- Average revenue (AR) 
		- AR = TR / Q = (P × Q) / Q = P
	- Marginal revenue (MR)
		- MR = ΔTR / ΔQ = Δ(P × Q) / ΔQ = P
	- Individual firm demand curve
		- P = AR = MR
		- Horizontal at P
	- Maximize profit
		- produce quantity where total revenue - total cost is greatest
			- If MR > MC
				- increase production
			- If MR < MC
				- decrease production
			- if MR = MC
				- the output level maximizes profit
		- Individual firm supply curve
			- Marginal cost curve
		- Short run decision
			- Shutdown
				- Short-run decision not to produce anything
				- Firm still has to pay fixed costs (sunk costs) and thus only the variable costs are considered
				- Sunk Cost
					- A cost that has already been committed and cannot be recouped
					- Should be ignored when making decision
				- if TR < VC or P < AVC
					- shut down
			- Supply curve
				- The portion of its marginal-cost curve that lies above average variable cost
			- Number of firms is fixed
				- each firm supplies quantity where P = MC
		- Long run decision
			- Exit
				- Firm still has to pay fixed costs (sunk costs) and thus only the variable costs are considered
				- Firm doesn’t have to pay any costs
				- if TR < TC or P < ATC
					- exit
				- if TR > TC or P > ATC
					- enter
			- Supply curve
				- The portion of its marginal-cost curve that lies above average total cost (minimum of ATC)
			- Process of entry and exit ends when 
				- firms still in market make zero economic profit (P = ATC)
				- at the efficient scale (MC = ATC ;minimum ATC)
				- Long run equilibrium
					- Long run market supply curve is perfectly elastic
						- Horizontal at minimum ATC
					- May be upward slope because some resources used in production may be available only in limited quantities
	- Market Adjustments
		- Increase in demand
			- market demand curve shifts outward
			- short run
				- higher quantity
				- higher price
					- P > ATC
				- new firms enter the market
				- short run market supply curve shifts right
				- price decreases back
