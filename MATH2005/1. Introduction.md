	- Statistical inference
	- Measure of reliability
	
	If a sample of size n is drawn from a population of size N in such a way that every possible sample of size n has the same chance of being selected, the sample is called a simple random sample
	- Selection bias
	- Nonresponse bias
	- Measurement error
