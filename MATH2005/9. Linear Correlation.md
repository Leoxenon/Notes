- Correlation
	- a rise or fall in one goes along with a corresponding rise or fall in the other
	- does not mean a change in one variable causes a change in the other
	- Properties of Correlation
		- Positive correlation
		- Negative correlation
		- Strong correlation
		- Weak correlation
		- No correlation
		- Nonlinear relationship
	- correlation coefficient
		- the strength of sample correlation
		- $R = \frac{SS_{xy}}{\sqrt{SS_{xx}S_{yy}}}$
		- $SS_{xy} = ∑(X_{i} - \bar{X})(Y_{i} - \bar{Y}) = ∑x_{i}y_{i} - \frac{∑x_{i}∑y_{i}}{n}$
		- $SS_{xx} = ∑(X_{i} - \bar{X})^2 = ∑x_{i}^2 - \frac{(∑x_{i})^2}{n}$
		- $SS_{yy} = ∑(Y_{i} - \bar{Y})^2 = ∑y_{i}^2 - \frac{(∑y_{i})^2}{n}$
	- population correlation coefficient
		- $ρ = \frac{E((X − µ_X)(Y − µ_Y))}{σ_Xσ_Y}$
	- Statistical Significance of Correlation Coefficient
		- $H_{0}: ρ=0$
		- $H_{A}: ρ≠0$
		- test statistic
			- $\frac{r\sqrt{n−2}}{\sqrt{1−r^2}}$
			- follows t distribution with degree of freedom n - 2
- Correlation does not necessarily imply causality
	- Possible explanations for a correlation
		- The correlation may be a coincidence
		- Both correlation variables might be directly influenced by some common underlying cause
		- One of the correlated variables may actually be a cause of the other. Note that, even in this case, it may not necessarily be the cause, but just one of several causes that work together
