- Derivative
	- $f'(x) = \lim\limits_{h \to 0}\frac{f(x+h)) - f(x)}{h}$
	- right hand derivative
		- $f'_+(x_o) = \lim\limits_{h \to 0^+}\frac{f(x_0+h)) - f(x_0)}{h}$
	- left hand derivative
		- $f'_-(x_o) = \lim\limits_{h \to 0^-}\frac{f(x_0+h)) - f(x_0)}{h}$
- Differentiation
	- the process of finding a derivative
	- $\frac{d}{dx}(Â·)$
		- the derivative with respect to x of
	- $f'(x_0) = \frac{dy}{dx}|_{x = x_0}$
		- the value of the derivative with respect to x at $x = x_0$
```
syms y x 
y = x^2 + 1 
g(x) = diff(y,x)
```
- Techniques of Differentiation
```
syms y x
y = (2*x^2 + 3*x + 1)^2 
diff(y,x)

syms y x 
y = 1/(x^2- 1)^5 
diff(y,x)
```

- Implicit Differentiation
	- differentiate both side before solving for y in terms of x
	- $\frac{dy}{dx} = - \frac{F_x}{F_y}$
		- $F_x = \frac{\partial F(x, y)}{\partial x}$
		- $F_y = \frac{\partial F(x, y)}{\partial y}$
```
syms y x 
F(x,y) = y^2 - x + 1
D(x, y) = -diff(F(x,y),x)/diff(F(x,y),y)
F(2,-1)
D(2,-1)
// not using this
G(x,y) = (y+1)/(x-2) == D(2,-1) 
solve(G(x,y),y)
```

- $n_{th}$ Derivatives
	- $f^{(n)} = \frac{d^ny}{dx^n}$
```
syms y x
y = 3 * x^4 + x * sin(x)
diff(y,x,2)
```

- Mean Value Theorem
	- If f(x) is continuous on [a,b] and is differentiable in (a,b), there exists at least a point c in (a,b) such that
		- $\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a} = f'(c)$
		- $f(b) = f(a) + (b - a)f'(c)$
		- $f(a+h) = f(a) + hf'(a)$
