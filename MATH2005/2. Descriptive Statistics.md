	- Graphical methods
		- dot plots
		- stem-and-leaf displays
		- histograms
	- Numerical measures
		- central tendency: mean, median, mode
		- variability: range, variance, standard deviation

- Skewness
	- mean >> median
		skewed to the right (positively skewed)
	- mean == median
		symmetric
	- mean << median
		skewed to the left (negatively skewed)

- Measures of relative standing (location)
	the relationship of a measurement to the rest of the data
	- Quartiles
		- QL: lower quartile, 25th percentile
		- M: median, 50th percentile
		- QU: upper quartile, 75th percentile
	- IQR = QU - QL
	- p-th Percentile
	- Sample z-score
		z = (x - a) / s
		- 68% of measurements (-1, 1)
		- 95% of measurements (-2, 2)
		- 99.7% of measurements (-3, 3)
	- Outlier
		data lies outside the range [QL −1.5×IQR, QU +1.5×IQR]
