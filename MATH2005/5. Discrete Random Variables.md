- Expected Value
	- $E(X) = ∑ xi * P(X = xi)$
	- $E(H(X)) = ∑ H(xi) * P(X = xi)$
	- Rules for Expectation
		- $E(c) = c$
		- $E(cX) = cE(X)$
		- $E(X ± Y) = E(X) ± E(Y)$
		- Sum of independent discrete variables
			![[Sum of Independent Discrete Variables.png]]
		- $E(Xi) =  µ$, then
			$E(Xa) = E(1/n ∑Xi)$
				$= 1/n E(∑Xi)$
				$= 1/n ∑ E(Xi)$
				$= 1/n*(nµ)$
				$= µ$

- Variance and Standard Deviation
	$Var(X) = σ^2$
		  $= E(X−µ)^2$
		  $= E(X^2+µ^2−2µX)$ 
		  $= E(X^2)+E(µ^2)−E(2µX)$
		  $= E(X^2)+µ^2−2µE(X)$
		  $= E(X^2)−µ^2$
		  $= E(X^2)−(E(X))^2$
	- Rules for Variance
		- $Var(c) = 0$
		- $Var(cX) = c^2 Var(X)$
		- $Var(X ±Y)=Var(X)+Var(Y)$

- Geometric Distribution
	- Geometric properties
		- Bernoulli trials
			- success
			- failure
		- trials are identical and independent
			- p remains the same
		- geometric random variable X
			- the number of trials needed to obtain the first success
	- sample space
		- S = {s, fs, ffs, fffs, ...}
		$P(X = 1) = p$
		$P(X = 2) = (1 - p)p$
		$P(X = 3) = (1 - p)(1 - p)p = (1 - p)^2 p$
		...
		$P(X =x)=(1−p)^{x−1} p$
	- X ~ Geo(p)
		- $E(X) = 1/p$
		- $Var(X) = (1 - p)/p^2$

- Binomial Random Variable
	- Binomial properties
		- n identical trials
			- S (Success)
				- probability: p
			- F (Failure)
				- probability: q = 1 - p
		- trials are independent
		- binomial random variable X
			- the number of S's in n trials
	- sample space
		- S = {fff, sff, fsf, ffs, ssf, sfs, fss, sss}
		$P(X =x)= C(n, x) p^x q^{n-x}$    , x = 0, 1, 2, ..., n
		$P(X = x) = 0$                        , elsewhere
	- X ~ Bin(n, p)
		- $E(X) = µ = np$
		- $Var(X) = σ2 =npq$

- Negative Binomial Distribution
	- reversal of binomial distribution
	- Properties
		- trials are observed until exactly r successes are obtained
		- negative binomial random variable X
			- the number of trials needed to obtain the r successes
	- sample space
		- S = {sss, ssfs, sfsfs, ffffsss, sffffss, ssffffs, ...}
		$P(X = x) = C(x-1, r-1) (1 - p)^{x-r}p^r$
		where r = 1, 2, 3, ... and x = r, r+1, r+2, ...
	- X ~ NegBin(r, p)
		- $E(X) = r/p$
		- $Var(X) = rq/p^2$

- Poisson Process 
	- observe discrete events in a continuous "interval" of time, length, or space
	- Properties
		- The occurrence of an event in an interval of space or time has no effect on the probability of a second occurrence of the event in the same, or any other, interval
		- Theoretically, an infinite number of occurrences of the event is possible in the interval
		- The probability of the single occurrence of the event in a given interval is proportional to the length of the interval
		- In any infinitesimally small portion of the interval, the probability of more than one occurrence of the event is negligible
	- $P(X =x)= e^{−λ} λ^x / x!$
	- X ∼ Poi(λ)
		- $E(X) =λ$
		- $Var(X) = λ$
