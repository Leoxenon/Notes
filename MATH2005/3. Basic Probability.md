- experiment
	an act or process of observation that leads to a single outcome
- sample point
	the most basic outcome of an experiment
- sample space
	the collection of all sample points
- event
	a specific collection of a sample point

- Classical Probability
	the outcome of an experiment can occur in N mutually exclusive and equally likely ways
- Relative Frequency Probability
	the relative frequency of the occurrence of a sample point
- Bayesian Probability
	a measure of a state of knowledge

- Additive Rule
	P(A∪B) =P(A)+P(B)−P(A∩B)

- Mutually Exclusive
	P(A∩B) =0
	P(A∪B) =P(A)+P(B)

- Conditional Probability
	P(A|B) = P(A∩B) / P(B), where P(B) != 0

- Multiplicative Rule
	P(A∩B) =P(A|B)P(B) = P(B|A)P(A)

- Independent Event
	P(A|B) = P(A)
	P(B|A) = P(B)
	P(A∩B) =P(A)P(B)

- No two events are mutually exclusive and independent at the same time
	P(A|B) = P(A∪B) / P(B) = P(A) != 0
	P(A∪B) != 0
	
- Law of Total Probability
	P(Ai) = ∑P(Ai∩Bj)
		= ∑P(Ai | Bj)P(Bj)
