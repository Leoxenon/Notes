- Hypothesis Testing
	- a standard procedure for testing a claim about a population parameter
	- Hypothesis
		- may be defined simply as a statement about one or more populations
	- Researh hypothesis
		- the conjecture or supposition that motivates the research
	- Null hypothesis ($H_{0}$)
		- the hypothesis to be tested
		- reject or not reject
	- Alternative hypothesis ($H_{A}$)
		- a statement of what we believe is true if our sample data cause us to reject the null hypothesis
		- usually same as the research hypothesis
		- complementary with null hypothesis
		- usually should be placed in the alternative hypothesis as the result of the test 
	- Statistical hypothesis
		- may be evaluated by appropriate statistical techniques
		- An indication of equality (=, ≤ or ≥) must appear in the null hypothesis
			- should contain a statement of equality
		- one tailed test (≤ or ≥)
		- two tailed test (=)
	- Test statistic
		- may be computed from the data of the sample
		- a decision maker to reject or not
		- (relevant statistic − hypothesised parameter) / standard error of the relevant statistic
	- Decision rule
		- Rejection region
		- Nonrejection region
	- Critical region
		- Critical values
			- values of the test statistic that separate the rejection and nonrejection regions
		- Critical region
			- the rejection region
	- Significance Level
		- level of significance α
			- determines the rejection region
			- 0.01, 0.05, 0.10
		- significant
			- A computed value of the test statistic that falls in the rejection region
			- α = P($H_{0}$ is rejected) when $H_{0}$ is true
	- Type of Errors
		- Type I error
			- the error committed when a true null hypothesis is rejected
		- Type II error
			- the error committed when a false null hypothesis is not rejected. The probability is designated by β
			- β = P($H_{0}$ is not rejected) when $H_{0}$ is false
	- p-value
		- a number that tells us how unusual our sample results are, given that $H_{0}$ is true
		- P(obtaining the test statistic as extreme as or more extreme than the one actually computed) when H0 is true
	- Conclusion of Testing
		- p-value < α
	- Power of test
		- power = P($H_{0}$ is rejected) when $H_{0}$ is false
		- power = 1−β

- One-Sided Hypothesis Tests
	- Two-sided test
		- the rejection region is split between the two sides of the distribution of the test statistic
		- $z_{0} < z(α/2)$ or $z_{0} > z(1 - α/2)$
		- If both large and small values will cause rejection of H0, a two-sided test is indicated
	- One-sided test
		- all the rejection region is in one or the other tail of the distribution
		- Upper-Tailed
			- $z_{0} > z(1 - α)$
		- Lower-Tailed
			- $z_{0} < z(α)$
		- When either sufficiently “small” values only or sufficiently “large” values only will cause rejection of H0, a one-sided test is indicated
		- the p-value is equal to the tail area beyond z0 in the same direction as the alternative hypothesis
	- Hypothesis Testing: Unknown Population Variance
		- $μ_{0} = \frac{\bar{X} - μ}{S / \sqrt{n}}$
		- when $H_{0}$ is true
			- is distributed as Student's T with γ = n − 1
			- The exact p-value for this test cannot be obtained since the table gives T values only for selected percentiles
				- use the larger p-value
				- protect the null hypothesis
	- Nonparametric Test
		- no assumption is being made concerning the specific population distribution (normally distributed population)
	- Single Population Variance
		- test statistic
			- $(n − 1)S^2/σ^2$ ~ $X_{n-1}^2$
	- Single Population Proportion
		- $np_{0} > 5$ and $n(1 - p_{0}) > 5$
			- $\frac{\hat{p} - p_{0}}{\sqrt{\frac{p_{0}(1 - p_{0})}{n}}}$ ~ N(0, 1)
