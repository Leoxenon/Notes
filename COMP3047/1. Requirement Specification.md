### Requirement Specification
1. **Prepare Project Background**
	- Current Environment Description
		- Description of Situation
			- A situation describes the **action** being caried out when the **entity** faces a specific **awareness** in certain **condition** and corresponding **environment** to achieve the **goal**. The performance of the action is **evaluated** which provides information for improvement.

				- what
					- Awareness
						- Issue of concern
						- transitional state
				- where
					- Environment
						- Location of the issue
						- Surrounding object
						- External influence
				- when
					- Condition
						- Co-condition
							- Pre-condition
							- Post-condition
				- why
					- Goal
			- 1H
				- how
					- Action
						- Operation
						- Procedure
						- Rule
					- Evaluation
						- Measures of performance
						- Judge
			- Describe and define problem and situation
		- Current System Description
			- Current system overview
			- Current system hardware, software, and network
			- Volumes and Frequencies
			- Interface with other systems (Optional)
		- Current Business Model
			- Understand how the process is performed currently
			- Use **Activity Diagram**, **Flowchart**, **Use Case Diagram** to model the current processes
				- Activity Diagram
					- Emphasizes the **flow of activity**
					- Model business activities in an **existing** or **potential** system
					- Elements
						- Activity
							- a behavior that is carried out while in a particular state
							- Rounded rectangle
						- Transition
							- a movement from one activity to another
							- Arrow
						- Decision point
							- a diamond symbol containing a condition whose results provide transitions to different paths of activities
							- Diamond
						- Synchronization bar
							- horizontal or vertical bars denoting parallel or concurrent paths of activities
							- top is a fork, bottom is a join
								- fork
									- one incoming transition
									- many outgoing parallel transitions
								- join
									- many incoming parallel transitions
									- one outgoing transition
						- Start
							- Black circle
						- End
							- Circled black circle
				- Flowchart Diagram
					- **Present processes visually**
					- Contains horizontal rows across the page
					- allowing the audience to quickly plot and trace processes and the interconnections between processes and business units/functions
				- Use Case Diagram
					- Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagram
					- **Represents a user’s interaction with the system**
					- Help developers understand the functional requirements of the system
					- Use case name is a short phrase **beginning with a verb** since a use case describes a process
					- Identify actors
						- person
						- organization
						- system
						- which interacts with a system
					- Types of Actors 
						- Initiating actor 
							- supplies system inputs 
						- Participating actor 
							- receives system outputs
					![[Use Case Diagram.png]]
					- Associations Between Use Cases
						- includes
							- one use case uses another use case
							- dotted-line arrow pointed toward the use case that is being used
						- extends
							- extends a use case by adding new behaviors or action
							- dotted-line arrow pointing toward the use case that has been extended
							- **Specialized use case extends the general use case**
					- Use Case Narrative
						- a structured narrative showing what the system must do to respond to a specific event
						- narrative
							- the sequence of internal actions by which the system responds to the actions of an actor
						- To prepare the use case narrative
							- we may first focus on **describing the expected system response** when all goes well
							- may be modified later to **describe exceptions and how errors in a system** input are handled
						- **One or more use case narratives for each use case**
						- Two levels of use case narratives
							- High-level use case narrative
								- consist of only two to three sentences
								- Helpful in **early analysis stage** to provide an overview of the scope and functionality of a system
							- Expanded use case narrative
								- List all actions
									- followed by the system’s response to it
								- The sequence of an actor’s actions and the corresponding responses of the system is known as a flow of events
								- Elements in an Expanded Use Case Narrative
									- use case
									- actors
									- purpose
									- overview
									- preconditions
										- A condition which must be true in order for the use case to begin and produce the desired results
									- postconditions
										- A condition which must be true after the use case has been completed
									- special requirements
										- A requirement which is **critical to users’ acceptance and use of the system**
									- flow of events
										- actor action $\to$ System Response
									- Alternative Flow of Events
										- What the system should do **in the case of exceptional conditions or errors**
2. **Identify problems / improvement areas**
	- Current problems and issues
		- What are the "common issues" faced by the users currently?
		- What are the "frequently asked questions" by the users currently?
		- What are the "time consuming" issues faced by the users currently?
	- Understand current situation and problem
	- Propose solution
3. **Ilustrate the source of information**
	- sources of information
		- book
		- interview
		- survey
		- internet
		- observation
4. **Provide an overview of the proposed system**
	- Proposed system overview
		- Brief description about proposed IT system to be developed
			- Solution to the Current Problem and Improvement Areas
	1. Proposed system features
		- Description of Proposed System
		- System User Profile
	2. Future business process & model
		- List future business processes for the system
		- Models the business processes with process diagrams
		- One business process $\to$ One diagram
5. **Functional Requirement**
	- Show functional requirements in numbered tables or paragraphs by **grouping them** according to **business nature or types of requirements**
	- With a unique requirement number
	- Assign priority (Must / Should / Could / Won’t)
6. **Non-Functional Requirement**
	- The features the proposed IT system must process from a business perspective
